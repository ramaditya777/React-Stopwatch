In the `useEffect` hook, when you return a function, it's referred to as a cleanup function. This function is executed when the component unmounts or when the dependencies specified in the second argument of `useEffect` change.

In the provided code snippet:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  let intervalId;

  if (isRunning) {
    intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(prevTime => prevTime + 1);
    }, 1000);
  }

  return () => {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
  };
}, [isRunning]);
```

- When the component mounts, the effect sets up an interval to update the time every second if `isRunning` is `true`.
- When the component unmounts or `isRunning` changes (if it's specified as a dependency), the cleanup function returned by `useEffect` is called.
- The cleanup function in this case clears the interval set up earlier using `clearInterval(intervalId)`. This ensures that the interval is properly cleared to avoid memory leaks or unnecessary processing after the component is no longer in use.

So, `return () => { clearInterval(intervalId); };` ensures that any resources or side effects created by the effect are cleaned up properly when the component is unmounted or when the `isRunning` state changes.
